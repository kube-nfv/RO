    This fixes bug 2217. Modified the cloud-init merge configs and defined
    the default SSH keys within the system_info instead of users.
    This bug fix doesn't break the creation of virtual machines that have
    a config drive. Now the merge_how dictionary is only appended to the user
    data in those cases where there is no config drive.
