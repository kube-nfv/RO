    This fixes the bug 2013 Anti-affinity group cannot be passed as instantiation
    parameter. NBI and RO are affected. For RO, if the attribute vim-affinity-group-id
    is present if the affinity group info, it is checked that it exists at the VIM
    and then is used. If it does not exist, an error message is shown in the RO logs,
    the atribute is ignored and a new new server group is created.
