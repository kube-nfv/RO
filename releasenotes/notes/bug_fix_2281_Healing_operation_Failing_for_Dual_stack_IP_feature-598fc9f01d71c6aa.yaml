    This change aims to fix auto heal operation failing for dual stack NS.
    This is happening because the function "_process_recreate_vdu_params"
    in osm-ngro/ns.py still expects a single IP instead of a list of IPs,
    as it was possible after the feature that enable dual stack IPs for
    VNF interfaces.
